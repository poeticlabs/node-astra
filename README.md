# node-astra (Astra)
### An IRC/XMPP crossover-communications robot, and companion.

_Use Astra to get your important notifications faster._

The majority of system/network monitoring applications can be configured to post their alerts to the Astra API, which then immediately notifies the appropriate users/conversations in some cases much faster than those programs can perform their own notifications, or update their own interfaces.

Response times average <50ms.

> **Astra** is the _one-and-only_ multipurpose: entertainment, notification, utility cross-over bot for IRC and XMPP/Jabber!
